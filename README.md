# codeception-Trivago

Requirements:  
- PHP
- Selenium
- Composer

Execute: composer install --dev

To run tests: vendor/bin/codecept run


I choosed to automate the signin and the sign up because those tests need to be run against every build/release of the application.

I didn't choose to use Codeception, I worked with it just because you requested that in the task description. I faced several problems with this tool especially because its community is too limited also their website was down when I started to use it (04-02-2018). I used to work with selenium webdriver, is more flexible and advanced.  

I only developed 3 test cases because I didn't have enough time to learn it. I could have finished the five tests if I had the freedom to choose the tool to use.
Example of problems which I faced: I couldn't click on h3 tags, I could only click on buttons.
